# Desktop Lackey

**Lackey** is a desktop application built ontop of [Neuron](https://github.com/Andrew-Shay/Neuron) (a Python project that allows an application's GUI to be built with HTML and Javascript). 

I chose ```Neuron``` over popular Python GUI libararies because I found the project very interesting and I also wanted to have a frontend that I felt only ```React``` could  properly deliver.

The goal of this project was an desktop application that I could customize and quickly reference without having to open a browser and go to bookmarks or tabs to obtain the information I am looking for.

Right now the application has the following features:
  - Calendar 
  - Notepad(s)
  - Weather Forecast
  - Stock Portfolio Tracker
  - Sports Schedule/Stats Tracker
    - NBA
    - EPL
    - NFL

The ```master``` branch of this repository will serve as a base version of the application or template for others to build or customize their own desktop applications using the work I have already done. I will continue developing lackey in my ```personal``` branch as a personalized version.

The only feature that requires an API key is ```finance```, go [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) and add your key to ```lackey/__info__.py``` in the ```API_KEYS``` dictionary.

## How To

 **1.** clone this repo
